Use this skill whenever a user wants to set up a new SPIKE graph — either with the existing AI industry demo data or for a new domain (biotech, fintech, crypto, geopolitics, macroeconomics, SaaS, climate tech, etc.). The flow presents a demo-vs-custom decision, then for custom setups asks about domain scope, actors, cadence, and sources, adapts schema and enums for the target domain, runs initial web research to generate real seed content, and executes init + load. Apply aggressively when the user says any of: set up Omnigraph, bootstrap a new graph, create a new SPIKE starter, I want to track X industry, initialize intel for Y, new graph for Z domain, start a new context graph, or similar phrasing.

# SPIKE Starter Bootstrap

This skill takes a user from zero to a populated, queryable SPIKE graph. Two paths:

- **Demo** — use the existing `industry-intel` starter (AI/ML signals as of early 2026). Good for demos, exploration, and understanding what SPIKE looks like populated.
- **Custom** — set up a new domain (biotech, crypto, fintech, geopolitics, etc.). Takes ~30–60 minutes including initial research and user review.

**Prerequisites:**

1. RustFS running on `127.0.0.1:9000`. If not, bootstrap with (**requires Docker** — install from https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/):
   ```bash
   docker version >/dev/null 2>&1 || { echo "Install Docker first: https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/"; exit 1; }
   curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ModernRelay/omnigraph/main/scripts/local-rustfs-bootstrap.sh | bash
   ```
   The bootstrap installs `omnigraph` and `omnigraph-server` binaries under `<workdir>/.omnigraph-rustfs-demo/bin/` — **not on PATH by default**. Either add it to PATH or invoke binaries by absolute path.

2. The `omnigraph-starters` repo cloned somewhere on disk. Ask the user where (or default to the current directory):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ModernRelay/omnigraph-starters.git
   ```
   Record the absolute path to the clone — the **Demo** path runs from `<clone>/industry-intel/`, the **Custom** path runs from `<clone>/` (repo root) so it can copy `industry-intel/` as a template.

## Step 0: Pre-flight checks

Before either path, run these checks (and act on the results):

```bash
# Are RustFS and any existing server reachable?
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "rustfs:%{http_code}\n" http://127.0.0.1:9000/
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "server:%{http_code}\n" http://127.0.0.1:8080/healthz

# Ensure omnigraph is on PATH (bootstrap installs outside PATH by default)
command -v omnigraph >/dev/null || export PATH="$PWD/.omnigraph-rustfs-demo/bin:$PATH"
command -v omnigraph >/dev/null || { echo "omnigraph not found — install via homebrew or adjust PATH"; exit 1; }

# Require omnigraph >= 0.2.2 (earlier versions lack `query lint`)
omnigraph version

# Does the starter have an .env.omni? If not, seed from the example.
[ -f <clone>/industry-intel/.env.omni ] || cp <clone>/industry-intel/.env.omni.example <clone>/industry-intel/.env.omni
```

**If `:8080` returns `200` from a server pointed at a different repo** (the bootstrap script auto-starts one), stop it before starting yours, or rebind to a free port via `omnigraph-server --bind 127.0.0.1:8090`.

The `.env.omni` file (created from the example above) contains the 7 mandatory AWS env vars:

```bash
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=rustfsadmin
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=rustfsadmin
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
AWS_ENDPOINT_URL=http://127.0.0.1:9000
AWS_ENDPOINT_URL_S3=http://127.0.0.1:9000
AWS_ALLOW_HTTP=true
AWS_S3_FORCE_PATH_STYLE=true
```

`AWS_ALLOW_HTTP` and `AWS_S3_FORCE_PATH_STYLE` are mandatory — omitting either gives a cryptic `builder error from lance-io` at init/load time.

## Step 1: Ask the user which path

Ask the user (use whatever structured-question primitive your runtime offers, or a plain prompt):

> Do you want to:
> - **Demo** — set up the AI industry intel demo (5 patterns, 15 signals, ~110 nodes, ready to query in ~30 seconds)
> - **Custom** — set up a graph for a new domain (I'll ask about your domain + sources, adapt the schema, research real seed data, and wire it up)

Branch based on the answer.

## Path A: Demo Setup

Quick — just clone, init, load.

See [`references/demo-setup.md`](references/demo-setup.md) for the full command list. Summary:

```bash
cd <path-to-clone>/omnigraph-starters/industry-intel
set -a && source ./.env.omni && set +a
# first time only: aws --endpoint-url http://127.0.0.1:9000 s3 mb s3://omnigraph-local
omnigraph init --schema ./schema.pg s3://omnigraph-local/repos/spike-intel
omnigraph load --data ./seed.jsonl --mode overwrite s3://omnigraph-local/repos/spike-intel
# Start the server (keep running), then query through it:
omnigraph-server --config ./omnigraph.yaml &
omnigraph read --config ./omnigraph.yaml --alias patterns disruption
```

After this, point the user at the `omnigraph-best-practices` skill for day-to-day operations.

## Path B: Custom Domain Setup

Six phases, in order. Don't skip ahead — each phase's output feeds the next.

### Phase 1 — Domain identification

Ask the user which domain they want to track. Present these as options:

- Biotech
- Fintech
- Manufacturing
- Crypto / web3
- Geopolitics
- Other (user specifies)

Then narrow:
- Scope: "all of X" or "only Y within X"?
- Global or regional?

Capture a **project slug** for the new starter: `bio-intel`, `crypto-intel`, `geo-intel`, etc. This becomes the folder name and the repo prefix (`s3://omnigraph-local/repos/<slug>`).

### Phase 2 — Key questions

Ask each in turn (multi-select where noted). See [`references/custom-domain.md`](references/custom-domain.md) for full phrasing and option lists.

- **Actors to track** (multi-select): companies, labs, regulators, individuals, protocols, investors
- **Time horizon**: recent only (3mo), medium (12mo), or full historical
- **Update cadence**: daily, weekly, monthly, ad-hoc
- **Primary consumer**: human analysts, internal dashboard, AI agents, mixed

### Phase 3 — Sources (most important)

Sources are the lifeblood of a SPIKE graph. The quality of the output is bounded by the quality of the sources. Spend time here.

Ask in order (see [`references/custom-domain.md`](references/custom-domain.md) for exact wording):

1. **Primary reading list** — newsletters, blogs, publications the user already reads (free-form, 5–15 entries)
2. **Priority analysts / experts** — 3–10 people whose takes should be first-class entities
3. **Regulatory / authoritative sources** — governmental, self-regulatory (FDA, SEC, IMF, etc.)
4. **Academic / primary sources** — journals, preprint servers, research aggregators
5. **Social / community** — X accounts, podcasts, forums

### Phase 4 — Confirm summary

Before making changes, echo what you captured back to the user:

- Domain + scope + project slug
- Actor types to track
- Horizon + cadence + consumer
- Source list (grouped by category)

Write this to `<slug>/setup-notes.md` in the new starter folder. Confirming now is cheap; rework later isn't.

### Phase 5 — Adapt the schema

From the **repo root** (`<clone>/`), copy `industry-intel/` as a template into `<slug>/`:

```bash
cd <clone>          # repo root, parent of industry-intel/
cp -r industry-intel <slug>
rm <slug>/seed.jsonl    # regenerated in Phase 6
```

Update in `<slug>/schema.pg`:

- `Element.kind` enum — replace with domain-appropriate kinds
- `Signal.domain` / `Element.domain` enum — replace with domain slices
- `Company.type` enum — match the ecosystem
- `SourceEntity.type` enum — match how sources publish
- `ArtifactType` enum — include domain-relevant formats
- Kind-specific Element properties (biotech wants `phase`, `moa`; crypto wants `chain`, `token_symbol`; etc.)

Update in `<slug>/omnigraph.yaml`:

- `graphs.local_s3.uri` → `s3://omnigraph-local/repos/<slug>`
- `project.name` → domain-appropriate name
- Optionally adjust aliases if query names change

**Pattern.kind** (`challenge`, `disruption`, `dynamic`) is usually domain-agnostic. Don't change it unless the user has strong reasons.

See [`references/schema-adaptation.md`](references/schema-adaptation.md) for the full keep-vs-change rules. See [`references/domain-examples.md`](references/domain-examples.md) for worked examples across biotech, crypto, fintech, geopolitics.

After editing:

```bash
cd <slug>
omnigraph query lint --schema ./schema.pg --query ./queries/signals.gq
```

Fix any lint errors before moving on.

### Phase 6 — Research, seed, init, load

Use web research to build real seed content. **Do not fabricate signals or dates.** See [`references/research.md`](references/research.md) for the workflow. High-level:

1. For each source from Phase 3, pull recent items (WebFetch / WebSearch)
2. Extract candidate signals (dated, URL-backed, specific)
3. Cluster into 3–5 patterns (recurring themes)
4. For each pattern, identify the Elements, Companies, Experts mentioned
5. Write `<slug>/seed.md` (tabular, human-readable) — **present this to the user for review before generating JSONL**
6. Generate `<slug>/seed.jsonl` from the confirmed seed.md
7. From `<clone>/<slug>/`, init, load, then start the server:

```bash
cd <clone>/<slug>
set -a && source ./.env.omni && set +a
omnigraph init --schema ./schema.pg s3://omnigraph-local/repos/<slug>
omnigraph load --data ./seed.jsonl --mode overwrite s3://omnigraph-local/repos/<slug>
omnigraph-server --config ./omnigraph.yaml &
```

8. Verify with a sample query (goes through the server):

```bash
omnigraph read --config ./omnigraph.yaml --alias patterns <pattern-kind>
```

### Phase 7 — Hand-off

Tell the user:

- What got created (starter folder, schema, seed counts, repo URI)
- How to query (via aliases or raw read)
- To use the `omnigraph-best-practices` skill for day-to-day ops (adding signals, schema evolution, branches)
